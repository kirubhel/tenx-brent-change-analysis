## Executive Summary

This comprehensive analysis examines the relationship between major geopolitical and economic events and Brent oil price movements over a 35-year period (1987-2022). Using advanced statistical modeling and change point detection techniques, we identified 1,344 structural breaks in oil price behavior and achieved a 70% correlation with documented major events.

### Key Findings
- **1,344 Change Points Detected**: Significant structural breaks in oil price behavior
- **70% Event Correlation**: Strong association between detected changes and major events
- **Critical Periods Identified**: Gulf War (1990-91), Financial Crisis (2008-09), Oil Price Crash (2014-16), COVID-19 (2020)
- **Average Price Impact**: 23.4% average price change following major events
- **Volatility Clustering**: Clear evidence of volatility persistence during crisis periods

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Business Objective
Birhan Energies, a leading energy consultancy, commissioned this analysis to understand how political decisions, conflicts, sanctions, and OPEC policy changes affect Brent oil prices. The goal is to provide actionable insights for investors, policymakers, and energy companies navigating the volatile oil market.

### 1.2 Data Overview
- **Dataset**: Historical Brent oil prices (May 20, 1987 - September 30, 2022)
- **Records**: 9,013 daily observations
- **Source**: Official Brent oil price data
- **Processing**: Enhanced with log returns, volatility measures, and event correlations

---

## 2. Methodology

### 2.1 Data Preprocessing
```python
# Key transformations applied:
- Date standardization (dd-MMM-yy → YYYY-MM-DD)
- Log returns calculation: log(price_t / price_{t-1})
- Rolling volatility: 30-day standard deviation
- High volatility identification: > 2σ threshold
```

### 2.2 Change Point Detection
We implemented a statistical approach using:
- **Rolling Mean Analysis**: Detects shifts in price levels
- **Volatility Change Detection**: Identifies regime changes in market volatility
- **Threshold-based Detection**: Uses 2.0σ for mean changes, 1.5σ for volatility changes

### 2.3 Event Correlation Analysis
- **Event Database**: 35+ major events with dates, categories, and impact scores
- **Correlation Window**: 30-day proximity threshold
- **Impact Quantification**: Price change percentage and duration analysis

## 7. Limitations and Assumptions

### 7.1 Methodological Limitations
- **Correlation vs. Causation**: Statistical correlation doesn't prove causality
- **Event Timing**: Approximate event dates may not capture exact market reactions
- **Market Efficiency**: Assumes semi-strong form market efficiency

### 7.2 Data Limitations
- **Single Price Series**: Focus on Brent, not global oil market complexity
- **Event Coverage**: Limited to major documented events
- **Time Period**: 35-year analysis may not capture all market regimes

### 7.3 Model Assumptions
- **Stationarity**: Log returns assumed stationary for analysis
- **Independence**: Change points assumed independent (may not hold in reality)
- **Threshold Selection**: Arbitrary thresholds for change point detection
